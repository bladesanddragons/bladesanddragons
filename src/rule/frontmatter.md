B&D is inspired by Dungeons and Dragons (D&D),

from Apocalypse World (AW)

## Design Notes

I love how excited people get talking about their best D&D games.
I want to play *that* game!
It would:
be about heroic fantasy adventure in a generic/flexible setting;
put the story first;
have less crunchy combat,
but more crunchy exploration and social stuff;
have fewer dice rolls, but each roll would *count*;
be easy to get started, but also have depth;
still *feel* like D&D 3e or 5e.

This early version of B&D is focused on getting the basics right
for one-shots and short campaigns at tier 1-2.

In a nutshell, B&D:
uses D&D's six stats, rescaled from 0-3;
reworks D&D skills into verbs;
uses BitD's action roll, fortune roll, and clocks;
adds the saving roll ("misfortune");
reworks BitD's resistance, armor, and stress ("strain");
tries to fit D&D class features/feats into this framework;
adds a freeform magic system with constraints based on D&D;
leans hard on D&D tiers to avoid numeric scaling;
uses AW-style threats.
