# Overview

## Introduction

### Rules

Blades and Dragons (B&D)
is a tabletop role-playing game (TTRPG) **hack**
that wraps the bones of the venerable
Dungeons and Dragons (D&D), Fifth Edition
with the muscles of the amazing
Blades in the Dark (BitD).
The result is a fast-paced, easy-to-learn,
cooperative improvisational storytelling game.

### Examples

Alongside the rules we'll have several examples of play.
Our cast of players is:

* Demi the Dungeon Master (DM)
* Ronia playing Robyn the ranger
* Dario playing Drake the druid

### Notes

B&D has also been inspired by
Apocalypse World (AW),
Dungeon World (DW),
Band of Blades (BoB),
and many other games.
There are lots TTRPGs
with D&D-ish flavor
that are well worth your time!

## What You'll Learn

### Rules

This guide is aimed at players who know D&D
and are curious about Indie RPGs like BitD,
but maybe a little hesitant.
You'll be able to convert a D&D character to B&D quickly and easily,
or make a new one from scratch, and get started playing.

### Examples

Ronia has been playing D&D since 3rd Edition.
Robyn is a conversion of her favourite D&D character.
Dario is new to TTRPGs.
Demi has played a lot of D&D but was afraid to DM
until she discovered B&D.

### Notes

To keep this guide short,
we're relying on your knowledge of D&D.
This game is designed to be easier to learn and play than D&D,
and much easier to DM.


## Story, Rules, Dice

### Rules

**Story** is the focus of B&D.
The rules help keep us on the same page.
The dice help keep us on our toes. 

## Tiers of Play

### Rules

Instead of levels we use the four familiar tiers:

* tier 1, levels 1-4: minor heroes
* tier 2, levels 5-10: major heroes
* tier 3, levels 11-16: epic heroes
* tier 4, levels 17-20: legendary heroes

### Examples

Our examples of play will use tier 1,
but the mechanics of B&D are the same at all tiers.

### Notes

Like D&D, each tier is more than twice as powerful then the last.
One tier 2 creature will be a challenge for a part of tier 1 PCs,
and a tier 3 creature will completely outclass them.
I strongly recommend that all the PCs in a party have the same tier.

## Stats and Rolls

### Rules

Player characters (PCs) have the same six stats from D&D,
but stats range from 0 to 3.
To make an action roll you roll a number of d6 and keep the highest:
6 means full success,
4-5 mixed success,
and 1-3 failure.
Multiple 6s mean a critical success.
A stat of 0 or 0D means roll 2d6 and keep the lowest
(like disadvantage in D&D).

### Examples

Robyn has a 2 in dexterity.
When Robyn shoots her bow,
Ronia rolls 2d6:

* 2, 3: highest is 3, so **failure**
* 1, 5: highest is 5, so **mixed success**
* 6, 3: highest is 6, so **full success**
* 6, 6: two 6s mean a **critical success**

### Notes

BitD uses twelve "action ratings" in three groups,
each of them a verb
that expresses a core element of the game.
John Harper calls this "the poetry layer".
I think the poetry of D&D requires the six stats.

## Action Roll

### Rules

To make an action roll, the player states their intent and picks a relevant stat.
The DM sets position and effect: the risk and the reward.
Position can be controlled, risky, or desperate.
Effect can be large or small, depending on the story and the PC's abilities.

### Examples

- Ronia: I attack the boar!
- Demi: Ok, what do you do?
- Ronia: I shoot it with my bow, so I roll Dex?
- Demi: Great! The boar is running at you, so risky position, standard effect.
- Ronia: Ok! [she rolls]

### Notes

Position and effect is the spark of genius at the heart of BitD.
It's the perfect level of granularity
for making quick judgments with meaningful differences.
Position and effect communicate the possible outcomes,
good and bad,
*before* the player rolls.

## Clocks

### Rules

For simple challenges, any success is enough.
For complex challenges the DM will set one or more "clocks".
The PCs must accumulate successes to fill the clocks
before they get too many failures.
We use clocks for all complex tasks:
**combat**, **exploration**, **social** interactions, everything!
Clocks can have 4, 6, 8, or more ticks to fill.
They can be independent or linked, sequential or parallel.
They can count up, down, back-and-forth.
Players take turns, PCs take actions, the clocks tick, and the story unfolds.

### Examples

Demi could set clocks for some of these:

* convince the terrified villagers to trust you
* track the demonic boar through the forest
* catch it before it attacks another village
* chase it through the Hag's Fen
* research the source of the demonic possession
* subdue the boar, with weapons and magic
* capture the demon, with magic and trickery
* complete the ritual to banish the demon, for now

### Notes

You may have heard of "skill challenges" in D&D.
They're a common house-rule solution
to make non-combat encounters more interesting.
Essentially, the PCs need to succeed on a number of checks
to complete a complex task.
BitD clocks add to this by counting successes and failures,
and by linking clocks into systems.

Ultimately, clocks help set the pace of the story:
where we spend our time and attention.

## Consequences

### Rules

On a failure or mixed success the PCs will face consequences:
setbacks or harm.
They can resist consequences using strain or armor,
which are the resources
that players must manage to keep the PCs alive.
When all strain is used up, the PC is unconscious.
Armor resets and strain reduces with rest.
Healing requires downtime or magic.

### Examples

### Notes

In BitD, scoundrels "stress".
In B&D, heroes "strain".
The mechanic is the same:
a single resource to do the work of
hit points, spell slots, limited-use abilities, etc.
Ultimately, strain is the mechanic
that lets players "get their way"
and push back against bits of the story,
but it's a limited resource.

## Fortune and Misfortune

### Rules

If a PC needs to resist a consequence that didn't result from an action roll,
they can make a misfortune roll.
If the DM isn't sure what will happen next,
they can call for a fortune roll.

### Notes

B&D fortune rolls are the same as in BitD.
Misfortune rolls replace BitD resistance rolls,
and are like D&D saving throws.
B&D is a more heroic game than BitD,
so PCs can take more hits, more predictably.

## Summary

### Rules

That's the core of the game:
action rolls, position and effect,
clocks, consequences, harm, strain and armor.

## Principles

### Rules

Keep these principles in mind:

## Prepare, don't plan

### Rules

**Prepare, don't plan.**
Imagine all the amazing things that could happen,
but don't decide until the moment arrives.
Build on what the DM and other players say and do,
then say "Yes, and … !"
The same thing goes for the PCs: jump into the action then use flashbacks.

### Notes

"Yes, and ...!" is the basic rule of improv.

## Balance for fun, not numbers

### Rules

**Balance for fun, not numbers.**
This is not a "balanced" game.
Every roll asks you to interpret the story
into a coarse grid of position and effect.
The important thing is to share the spotlight and the fun.

### Notes

This principle might be hard for some groups.

## Ask questions, answer honestly

### Rules

**Ask questions, answer honestly.**
There's no plan and there's no balance,
so "metagaming" just isn't a problem.
The PCs are skilled, experienced heroes.
The DM should tell the players what the PCs know, intuit, suspect, or guess.
The players should ask how they could do what they want,
and the DM should answer honestly.

### Notes

D&D grew out of tabletop wargames,
and there's a lingering vibe of "players vs DM".
In AW and BitD and B&D we *play to see what happens*.

## Consequences aren’t failures

### Rules

**Consequences aren’t failures.**
The PCs are competent.
A failed roll means that your epic hero faces a setback,
not that they tripped on their own feet.
A setback is a chance to be more heroic!
The mechanics push for mixed success.

### Notes

This principle is easy to apply in any TTRPG,
and your game will be better for it.
AW and BitD are explicitly built around mixed success,
which embraces "Yes, and ...!"
and is the most *interesting* outcome of any roll.

## Inspiration and adaptation

### Rules

**Inspiration and adaptation.**
The fiction comes first,
and the rules support the fiction,
which makes homebrew easy and safe.
Draw on the D&D Player's Handbook, the Monster Manual,
and every other fantasy RPG book.
Then imagine something new!

### Notes

The mechanics of B&D are meant to support your storytelling,
whatever inspired it,
and wherever that inspiration leads.
Use the examples below to get a feel for the system,
then use your gut.
